## Introduction

Rapidocity.ai ("we," "our," or "us") develops mobile applications designed to help families stay connected safely. This Privacy Policy explains how our applications, including Sentinel Dialer, collect, use, and protect your information.

## Information We Collect

Our apps may request access to the following device permissions:

### Contacts
- We access contact names and phone numbers stored on your device to display them within the app for easy calling.
- Contact data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.

### Phone
- We request permission to initiate phone calls when you tap a contact within the app.
- We do not record calls or transmit call audio.

### Call Logs
- We access call history to display recent call information (such as "Called yesterday") within the app.
- Call log data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.

## Data Storage

All personal data, including your contacts, call history, favorites, and app settings (such as PIN codes and emergency contacts), is stored locally on your device. We do not operate servers that collect or store your personal information.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. Since all data remains on your device, we have no access to it.

## Children's Privacy

Our apps are not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
